# What is H - Bridge ?
An H - Bridge is an electronic circuit that switches the polarity of a voltage applied to a load. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow DC motor to run forwards or backwards.

# App Scenario
For the better understading of the internal working of h - bridge i've designed this app so that it would be easier to learn about it's internal working.

# Note
This app is designed to make my class fellows understand about it's internal working by giving a presentation. Hence, this app was designed only for that purpose therefore it is not responsive. If you would like to see the proper video of this app in action contact me through my facebook [@hasnainkarim262](https://www.facebook.com/hasnainkarim262)
